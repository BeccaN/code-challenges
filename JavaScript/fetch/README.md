* Starting with a file index.js with:

`var url = "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random/4"`
and a standard index.html that loads the index.js

* Add javascript so that - on page load - fetch the images - parse the response as json - add image elements to the DOM for each image in the array

* BONUS: When user scrolls up on page, resize images to 50% of their original size. When user scrolls down, resize images to 200% of their original size.
