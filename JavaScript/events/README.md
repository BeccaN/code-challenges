# JavaScript Events

## Part 1: Conceptual questions
1. What is a JavaScript Event? Why is it useful?
2. How do we "hook into it" in our code?
3. Where can we find different Event types available to us?
4. What is Scope or Execution Context?

## Part 2: Coding Challenge - Creating Event Listeners
* Visit this website: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_art
* Using the developer console, accomplish the following:
1. Change the background color of the Contents div to grey WHEN THE USER CLICKS THE DIV
2. Create an <li> with the text "Bonus Chapter" and Add this `<li>` as the last item in the Contents div WHEN THE USER PRESSES THE "l" KEY
4. Console log ("user has arrived at site" when the DOM first loads)
